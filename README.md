# JPEG Artifact Remover (jpeg2png)
This is a frontend for [jpeg2png](https://github.com/ThioJoe/jpeg2png) written in Lazarus and FreePascal. It allows you to reduce JPEG artifacts caused by JPEG encoding and give you a clean PNG file. This application uses a fork of the [original project](https://github.com/victorvde/jpeg2png) made by [ThioJoe](https://github.com/ThioJoe/jpeg2png) which fixes a few bugs.

# How to use?
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/theonlyasdk/jpeg-artifact-remover/releases) and download the appropriate binary for your system.
- Run the application and click the `Download` button.
- It will take you to the page where you can download [jpeg2png](https://github.com/ThioJoe/jpeg2png/releases).
- Download jpeg2png to your Downloads folder and choose the exe file in the application.
- Now, choose the image you want to process and click `Convert To PNG`
